# AngularFirebaseAuthDemo

This mini-project is a demo of the features provided by Firebase Authentication. The [FirebaseUI-Angular](https://github.com/RaphaelJenni/FirebaseUI-Angular) library was leveraged, which already implements optimized flows for most use-cases.

A live demo of this project can be viewed here:<br>

P.S. A more customizable/manual approach for implementing customized flows for user authentication is documented in the 'firebaseauth' branch. That implementation is not yet complete.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
